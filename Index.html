    <Section>
        <p> I'm a second year mechanical engineering student at the University of Toronto. My passion for
            engineering and design has led me to work on many self driven projetcs and develop skills in programming,
            mechatronics, and CAD to compliment what I've learned at school. I'm on the brakes subsection of the
            University of Toronto Formula SAE racing team, but I also like to help with any other subsections that need
            it. I have leadership and management experience from six years in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.
            <br> I'm currently looking for a four month summer internship opportunity so check out my
            <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio!</a>
